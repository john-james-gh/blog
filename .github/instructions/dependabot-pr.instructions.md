# Dependabot PR Review Instructions

When the PR author is `dependabot[bot]` or `dependabot`, perform a comprehensive dependency update review and post your findings as a comment.

## Review Checklist

Answer the following questions about the updated dependency:

### 1. Usage Analysis

**Is the package used once?**

- Search the codebase for import statements of this package
- Count the number of files importing from this package
- Determine if usage is centralized or widespread

### 2. Necessity Assessment

**Can it be removed and rewritten in the codebase instead?**

- Evaluate if the package provides unique functionality
- Consider if the functionality is simple enough to implement directly
- Assess maintenance burden vs. reimplementation cost
- For small utility packages, consider inline implementation
- For complex packages (frameworks, build tools), recommend keeping

### 3. Test Coverage Requirements

**Do I need new tests?**

- Check if the update includes breaking changes
- Review changelog for API modifications
- Determine if existing tests cover the updated functionality
- Recommend new tests for:
  - Breaking changes
  - New features being adopted
  - Changed behavior in critical paths

## Generate Facts Block

Create a structured facts block with the following information:

### Usage Count

```bash
# Search for import statements
grep -r "from ['\"]<package-name>" src/
grep -r "require(['\"]<package-name>" src/
```

Report: "Used in X files across Y locations"

### Affected Projects

```bash
# Use Nx to determine impact (if Nx is configured)
npx nx print-affected --type=lib --type=app
```

Report affected project names or "N/A (single project)" if not using Nx monorepo

### Dependency Type

- Parse `package.json` to determine if the package is in:
  - `dependencies` (production)
  - `devDependencies` (development only)
  - `peerDependencies` (peer requirement)

Report: "Dev-only: Yes/No"

### Version Change Analysis

Extract from PR title or description:

- **Change Type**: Major (X.0.0) / Minor (0.X.0) / Patch (0.0.X)
- **Version**: `old.version.number` ‚Üí `new.version.number`
- **Changelog URL**: Construct URL from package repository
  - npm: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/v/<version>`
  - GitHub: Check package.json repository field for CHANGELOG.md

## Comment Format

Use **real line breaks**, not `\n`.  
Post a comment to the PR with this structure for each updated dependency:

ü§ñ Dependabot PR Review

üì¶ Package: `<package-name>`

**Version Change**: `old.version` ‚Üí `new.version` (**Major/Minor/Patch**)

üìä Facts

- **Usage Count**: Used in X files across Y import locations
- **Affected Projects**: `project-a`, `project-b` (or "N/A - single project")
- **Dev-only**: Yes/No
- **Changelog**: [View changes](changelog-url)
- **Known Codemod**: Yes - `npx command` / No

‚úÖ Review Findings

**Is the package used once?**
[Your analysis - e.g., "No, widely used across 15 components"]

**Can it be removed and rewritten?**
[Your assessment - e.g., "Not recommended. This is a core framework dependency with complex functionality"]

**Do I need new tests?**
[Your recommendation - e.g., "Yes, the changelog indicates breaking changes to the API. Recommend testing:

- Feature X behavior
- Integration with Y component"]

üö¶ Recommendation

**Action**: ‚úÖ Approve and merge / ‚ö†Ô∏è Review required / ‚ùå Do not merge

**Reasoning**: [Brief explanation]

**Next Steps**:

1. [Specific action items if needed]
2. [E.g., "Run codemod before merging"]
3. [E.g., "Add tests for new API"]
