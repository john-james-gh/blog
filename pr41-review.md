✅ REVIEW FINDINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IS THE PACKAGE USED ONCE?
No, widely used throughout the application. Found imports in 16 source files with 25 total import statements. The package is used across multiple feature areas:
- Core app routing and pages (app/layout.tsx, app/not-found.tsx, app/sitemap.ts, app/robots.ts)
- Frontend components (author, disable-draft-mode)
- Blog post pages (posts/[slug]/page.tsx, page.tsx)
- Sanity CMS integration (portable-text-components, queries, live preview)
- API routes (draft-mode endpoints)
- Studio integration (studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx)

CAN IT BE REMOVED AND REWRITTEN?
Not recommended. Next.js is the core framework dependency that provides:
- Server-side rendering and static site generation infrastructure
- App Router architecture
- Image optimization via next/image
- Font optimization via next/font/google
- API routes and middleware
- Integration with Sanity CMS via next-sanity

Removing this would require rewriting the entire application from scratch. This is a fundamental framework dependency, not a utility package.

DO I NEED NEW TESTS?
No new tests required. This is a patch release (15.5.3 → 15.5.4) that includes bug fixes only, with no breaking changes according to the release notes.

**Release highlights:**
- Bug fixes for error overlay, devtools positioning, and turbopack improvements
- Fixes for onRequestError invocation with OpenTelemetry
- Improvements to symlink handling and metadata route processing
- No API changes or breaking modifications

The existing e2e tests in `src/e2e/` (home.spec.ts, post.spec.ts, studio.spec.ts) should adequately cover the functionality and detect any regressions from these bug fixes.

🚦 RECOMMENDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ACTION: ✅ Approve and merge

REASONING: This is a safe patch update containing only bug fixes and improvements with no breaking changes. The fixes address important issues with error overlays, turbopack, and development tooling that will improve the developer experience. As a core framework dependency, keeping Next.js up to date with patch releases ensures the application benefits from bug fixes and stability improvements.

NEXT STEPS:

1. Run existing e2e tests to verify no regressions: `pnpm test:e2e`
2. Verify local development server works: `pnpm dev`
3. Merge once CI passes
